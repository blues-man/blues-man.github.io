I'm a Software Engineer with a consolidated background on Telecommunications and Mobile Platforms. Use Java, Javascript, Perl, Python, Go in my daily tasks.

I like Operative Systems and Software isolation techniques such as Virtualization and Containers, working efficiently on Linux Server environments, KVM, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and Docker. I'm familiar with Cloud computing theory and Public Cloud systems as Amazon AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure and I like to study and analyze distributed architectures and file systems. 

I work mostly on Kubernetes and OpenShift as DevOps and/or Solution Architect.

My favorite configuration management tool is Puppet, but I feel also comfortable with Ansible and Saltstack.
